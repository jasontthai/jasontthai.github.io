Here is a list of my recommended browser extensions that will make your browsing experience safer:

<!--more-->

* [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger/) -  Privacy Badger is a browser add-on that stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web. Privacy Badger learns about trackers as you browse by inspecting external resources websites request. Please be aware that Google Analytics is considered first-party by Privacy Badger, which means that Google Analytics will not be blocked if you do not use another blocker, such as uBlock Origin. 
* uBlock Origin [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) - An efficient [wide-spectrum-blocker](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode) that's easy on memory, and yet can load and enforce thousands more filters than other popular blockers out there. It has no monetization strategy and is completely [open source](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/). We recommend Firefox but uBlock Origin also works in other browsers such as Safari, Opera, and Chromium. Unlike AdBlock Plus, uBlock does not allow so-called ["acceptable ads"](https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads).
* [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) - A Firefox, Chrome, and Opera extension that encrypts your communications with many major websites, making your browsing more secure. A collaboration between The Tor Project and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
