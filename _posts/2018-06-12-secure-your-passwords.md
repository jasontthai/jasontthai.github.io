Do you use the same password for most of your common sites? Is your password easy to remember or to
guess? You may find the convenience in only having to remember one password but that significantly
increases the chance of it being hacked, especially when various security breaches have happened
lately.  If you find yourself doing this, it is important to take some time to change your passwords
and make them more secure.

How do we find the balance of having secure passwords with the convenience of easy recalling? There
is a perpetual search for this solution but here are some suggestions

# Use a Long Password
__Longer passwords are always harder to crack__. Consider using a password that has at least 12 characters.

__Avoid__ names, places, dictionary words

__Make use of__ capitalizations, punctuations, numbers and spelling.

Here is password that apply all of these rules: *__mE8$pX1xF@x3uyC__* and some of its stats provided

# Never Reuse a Password (Use a Password Management Tool)
It is challenging to come up with a new password, let alone having to remember a complicated one
like above but it is important to do this. Often we want to have more secure passwords and different
ones for our sites, while staying away from remembering all of them.

A solution for this is to use password managers. There are a couple of options:

* [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) or [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) - These are
online tools that include browser extensions  to help you manage your passwords. They can auto
generate passwords and store them on the clouds so you can access them on any devices. All you need
to do is remember 1 master password (a secure one!) to access all the data stored in the tool. Enter
your master password, and the password manager takes care of the rest.
* [Lesspass](https://lesspass.com/#/) - Stateless password manager. You only need to provide the site, login, and the one master password of your choice and a password will be auto generated for you. You can also host this service yourself.
* [KeypassX](https://www.keepassx.org) - This has the same functionality as LastPass or 1Password but
it is an offline tool. If you are serious about your security and don't want other providers to keep
your data, you can use this to manage your passwords.

Another extra thing you can do is to make use of both password managers and memorization. Memorize the passwords
for your most common sites and use password managers for the rest.
