How do you celebrate anniversaries? Do you go to a fancy restaurant or prepare an intimate meal at home? Either option is great. What is important is that you get to spend some quality time with your loved one to celebrate the special day that you guys experienced however long ago.  Sometimes though, for reasons, you guys cannot spend the time together on your special anniversary and that blows because you really want to. Well you are not alone. I and probably many other have experienced the same issue. You see, I could not spend many anniversaries with my best friend (and now wife) because we had a long distance relationships for many years. Did we ever let the fact that we could not spend much time together affect us? Yes, we did in multiple occasions. However, we always decided to stick together and ride through the storm that coexists with our relationship. So what should you? On the day where you are supposed to celebrate with each other but can't, I'd say remember about the past, all the events that happened that made this day anniversary. You can send your loved one a text message, or in my case a blog post to remind your someone how much you care. And you can tell them that this anniversary, although lonely it can be, makes you forever more cherish the fact you guys are still in love with each other and that you wish this will be the last anniversary you guys are not each other. After all the person is very important to you. With that, I just want to say the existence of anniversaries, though can be quite superficial, is an important aspect of your life.
