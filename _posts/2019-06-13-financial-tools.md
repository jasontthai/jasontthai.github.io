Here is a list of my recommended financial tools that will enhance your experience of managing your finance:

### Tools

* [Vanguard](https://vanguard.com) - Financial advisor and brokerage. In my opinion this is the best broker in the market for its low expense ratio funds.
* [Wealthfront*](/go/wealthfront) - If you prefer a more DIFM (Do it for me) investment, Wealthfront offers some excellent options of auto investment. It also offers a cash account with high APY compared to other alternatives.
* [Robinhood*](/go/robinhood) - Commission-free investing app. You can purchase stocks for zero fee using the app. 
* [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com) - It is a free tool to manage and keep track of your investiments. You can also track your transactions, networth, asset allocation, retirement analysis and more.
* [Mint](http://mint.com) - It is another alternative to Personal Capital. It does not offer as many features as PC but less is more. The UI looks cleaner in my opinion.
* [YNAB*](/go/ynab) - If you prefer a more DIY budgeting tools, I highly recommend YNAB. The site also features some workshop to guide you more about budgeting.

*These are affiliate links and should you chose to do business with them, this blog will earn a small commission.

### Books

* [The Simple Path to Wealth](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Path-Wealth-financial-independence/dp/1533667926) - This book provides a simple approach to investing.
* [The Millionaire Next Door](https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474) - What's a millionaire really like and how to become one.

I hope these tools will also benefit you like they do for me. Managing finance is never easy but these tools hopefully will ease you into taking a more active role in doing it.
