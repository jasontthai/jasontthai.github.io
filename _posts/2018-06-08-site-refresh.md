It has been a while since I last updated this site (almost 2 years - time flies!),
I have refreshed this site with a new theme and updated my info that reflect my
current status. There have been some changes since the last time I was here. 
It has been a year since CastAR's shutdown. Joining CastAR has been a life-changing 
experience for me as I embarked on start up journey. Needless to say, despite the shutdown,
I had a wonderful experience at my first start up and it really helped me embrace
the start up vibe. Now I am working at a new company called [Nauto](https://www.nauto.com) 
which has a different set of problems to solve and I have to say I am as excited 
as ever to continue the start up journey. 

In case you are not aware of Nauto, our company is trying to make driving
smarter and safer by engaging with some of the biggest commercial fleets and
insurance companies to help measure drivers' attentiveness and their driving skills
through our multi-sensor device with powerful AI engine that gets installed in
commmercial vehicles. You can always check out for more information in the link
I mentioned.

With that I am going to end the first post of this refreshed site. Take it easy.
