This makes it restricting when you want to use a custom Jekyll gem or your own plugin. After doing a bit of research, I have figured out a way to also enable automatic deployment of your own site while also has the ability to use your own dependencies not supported yet by Github Page. One of the ways is to use CircleCI for automatic build and deployment of your static site to your Github Page repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: this tutorial assumes that you already know how to host your static site on Github Page. Otherwise, you can check out some  &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/en/categories/github-pages-basics&quot;&gt;guides&lt;/a&gt; available on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;circleci&quot;&gt;CircleCI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CircleCI is a very  powerful continuous integration tool, which allows rapid builds and deployment of your projects.  Open source projects are supported and get free builds so as long as your static website is located on a public repository on Github, you won’t have to pay anything to use it. CircleCI also supports one job build for private project so you can also use it for your personal private project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploy-to-github-page-with-circleci&quot;&gt;Deploy to Github Page with CircleCI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to grant CircleCI access to your repo. This is done by adding a deploy key to allow read and write access so that CircleCI can read and push your changes. You can find out how to do it &lt;a href=&quot;https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/gh-bb-integration/#enable-your-project-to-check-out-additional-private-repositories&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is to configure the build and deployment step so CircleCI knows what to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;create--circleciconfigyml-with-the-following-content&quot;&gt;Create  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.circleci/config.yml&lt;/code&gt; with the following content:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;circleci/ruby:2.4.3-node-browsers&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;USER_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;XXX &amp;lt;- replace with your github username&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;USER_EMAIL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;XXX &amp;lt;- replace with your email&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;checkout&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;install dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;gem update --system&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;gem install bundler&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;restore_cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Deploy Release to GitHub&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;if [ $CIRCLE_BRANCH == 'source' ]; then&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;bash .circleci/setup-github.sh&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;workflows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;config.yml&lt;/code&gt; file declares the steps for CircleCI to execute, you can see that we are telling CircleCI to checkout the repo, update bundler, restore gems cache, run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt; , save gems cache, build the static site by executing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build&lt;/code&gt; and finally if the code is pushed to &lt;strong&gt;source&lt;/strong&gt; branch, the script &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;setup-github.sh&lt;/code&gt; is executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-circlecisetup-githubsh-with-the-following-content&quot;&gt;Create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.circleci/setup-github.sh&lt;/code&gt; with the following content:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git config user.name &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$USER_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
git config user.email &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$USER_EMAIL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

git checkout master
git pull origin master

find &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-maxdepth&lt;/span&gt; 1 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'_site'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'.git'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'.gitignore'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'.circleci'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-rf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mv &lt;/span&gt;_site/&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-R&lt;/span&gt; _site/

git add &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-fA&lt;/span&gt;
git commit &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--allow-empty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;git log &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--pretty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;%B&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
git push &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; origin master

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;deployed successfully&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are telling CircleCI to checkout the &lt;strong&gt;master&lt;/strong&gt; branch of the repo. For personal website, Github Page uses master branch to render the site. By default, Github Page will build the site and use the contents under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; directory to render the site. However, since we are using CircleCi to build the site, we just have to copy all the contents under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; that have already been built and put them in the root directory, that way Github Page can render the contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have created these files, commit and push the changes to &lt;strong&gt;source&lt;/strong&gt; branch. You will see a new build will start in CircleCI, which will execute all the steps mentioned above and put the new changes of your site on &lt;strong&gt;master&lt;/strong&gt; branch. Once it’s done, your changes will be available for viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;added-benefit-custom-jekyll-dependencies--plugins&quot;&gt;Added benefit: Custom Jekyll Dependencies + Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, if we let Github Page handle the build of our site, only a limited number of dependencies and plugins are supported. However, now we have switched to CircleCI and build the site ourselves, this comes with an additional benefit which is all the Jekyll dependencies and plugins are now supported. Some of you may be aware that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2&quot;&gt;jekyll-paginate-v2&lt;/a&gt; is not yet supported by Github Page, but now you can take advantage of the new additional features of this dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-thoughts&quot;&gt;Other thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also thought about separating the source code of the site in a separate repo so CircleCI can read from this source repo and build and make changes to the actual Github Page repo. This provides the benefits of decoupling the source and the generated sites. For now, I leave this as an exercise so you can find out more about the functionalities of CircleCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jason</name></author><category term="en" /><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Since I have been playing with Github Pages to host my own website, I notice although there is a lot of automation out of the box to host the static website, Github only supports a few jekyll dependencies which can view here.

I like it for its cleanliness and simplicty as the name implies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as you know I enjoy customizing things my way so I did make a few changes to make this blog a bit more to my liking (for now. After all I have switched themes a few times). Here are a couple of new additions that I added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;added-subscribe-feature-through-email-or-rss&quot;&gt;Added subscribe feature through email or RSS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently trying out &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedburner.google.com&quot;&gt;feedburner&lt;/a&gt; to handle subscription for the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-excerpt-and-introduce-hover-effects-on-the-post&quot;&gt;Use excerpt and introduce hover effects on the post.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you visit my homepage, you will notice each post contains an excerpt and if you hover over the post, you’ll see a fading effect. The suggestion was made my the maintainer of Jekyll’s theme and I ended up implementing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;added-next-and-previous-post-link&quot;&gt;Added next and previous post link&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF you view a post, at the end of the post there is are hyperlinks to the next and previous posts to save you some clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;added-pagination-and-style-each-post-as-a-card-view&quot;&gt;Added pagination and style each post as a card view.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos to &lt;a href=&quot;http://prashanthmadi.github.io&quot;&gt;prashanthmadi.github.io&lt;/a&gt; for adding pagination and the card view that looks really nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definition of &lt;strong&gt;anniversary&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anniversary&quot;&gt;Merriam-Webster&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;1: The annual recurrence of a date marking a notable event
&lt;br /&gt;
// a wedding anniversary
&lt;br /&gt;
broadly : a date that follows such an event by a specified period of time measured in units other than years
&lt;br /&gt;
// the 6-month anniversary of the accident&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2: The celebration of an anniversary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you celebrate anniversaries? Do you go to a fancy restaurant or prepare an intimate meal at home? Either option is great. What is important is that you get to spend some quality time with your loved one to celebrate the special day that you guys experienced however long ago.  Sometimes though, for reasons, you guys cannot spend the time together on your special anniversary and that blows because you really want to. Well you are not alone. I and probably many other have experienced the same issue. You see, I could not spend many anniversaries with my best friend (and now wife) because we had a long distance relationships for many years. Did we ever let the fact that we could not spend much time together affect us? Yes, we did in multiple occasions. However, we always decided to stick together and ride through the storm that coexists with our relationship. So what should you? On the day where you are supposed to celebrate with each other but can’t, I’d say remember about the past, all the events that happened that made this day anniversary. You can send your loved one a text message, or in my case a blog post to remind your someone how much you care. And you can tell them that this anniversary, although lonely it can be, makes you forever more cherish the fact you guys are still in love with each other and that you wish this will be the last anniversary you guys are not each other. After all the person is very important to you. With that, I just want to say the existence of anniversaries, though can be quite superficial, is an important aspect of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To San and Vy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know both of you do not like to talk about money. After all you are usually busy or have better things to do - Vy with your internship and thesis and San with your part time job and rotation. This is why I write this post so at least you have some place to read about it when you have the time. And I promise I will keep this short and easy to understand. After all, we do have to talk about this and it is better to do it now than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon working for a while, you may start noticing that your bank account is going up. YOU HAVE SOME MONEY. You may start wondering what you can do with that money. You may think about spending that money on a fancy meal, a pair of new shoes, or that beautiful dress that you had your eyes on for a while. You may have already spent a bit of your money on the things mentioned already. But then, growing up you are taught to be frugal and never spend all the money that you have so you want to save them. This is where I want to come in and offer some help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the first few &lt;em&gt;INITIAL&lt;/em&gt; steps that you can do (There will be more):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If  you have not done it already, start setting up a budget and keep track of you expense and income. In order to know how much you can save, you need to know how much you are earning and spending. @San, Vy made one for you &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QcXNs1b35f-vd9t82PB5aL8n1TTsil8HQD-1WbGZJ54/edit#gid=416635166&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After you know how much you spend for a month, start saving up for an emergency fund (ideally 3 to 6 months of your monthly expense). This will be your safety net in case some emergency happens. This money will also be the foundation to show that you can save money and live below your mean.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have very high interest debt, start paying them. @San, you can think about paying for your tuition bit by bit now (depending on the interest, which I figure is high)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some other next steps after the first 3 above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put your emergency fund into a high yield saving account to earn interest. (I can show you how to do this).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start learning more about 401K, Traditional/Roth IRA (I will put up another post to go into details about this. For now, you can ignore)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also take a look at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png&quot;&gt;flowchart&lt;/a&gt; and check out reddit’s personalfinance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; to find out more about all things personal finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why you need to do all this stuff? The answer is simple. This is to help you get started on being financially responsible and eventually finanical independent. You may wonder what the heck is financial independence. I promise it will be very fun to know about this and not boring at all even though it also revolves around money a bit. For now, enough money talk for the day.

I admit I have not been taking good care of them lately and I promised my wife I would do a better job from now on. It took about an hour to replace the soil (the old one was actually kinda gross!) and trimming the succulents. I checked out a couple of websites to make sure I trimmed correctly but one never knows. I hope they can grow back to their beautiful selves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/succulent.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;succulents&quot; /&gt;
Look how small and cute they are now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder: why do we procrastinate and put off things so much. I thought about doing this a long time ago but never got to do it. I am glad I did it today. This was actually quite a self meditative activity as I was so focused on the task. I should not put things off so much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking lately about how to grow myself and do something new. Perhaps taking care of plants can be one of them. Unfortunately I do not have a lot of space to grow plants. How do one improve oneself? A part of me also wants me to take it easy and not force myself to do too much. I need to find a better balance between forcing myself to do things and doing things out of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

I admit I have not been taking good care of them lately and I promised my wife I would do a better job from now on. It took about an hour to replace the soil (the old one was actually kinda gross!) and trimming the succulents. I checked out a couple of websites to make sure I trimmed correctly but one never knows. I hope they can grow back to their beautiful selves. Look how small and cute they are now. This makes me wonder: why do we procrastinate and put off things so much. I thought about doing this a long time ago but never got to do it. I am glad I did it today. This was actually quite a self meditative activity as I was so focused on the task. I should not put things off so much anymore. I have been thinking lately about how to grow myself and do something new. Perhaps taking care of plants can be one of them. Unfortunately I do not have a lot of space to grow plants. How do one improve oneself? A part of me also wants me to take it easy and not force myself to do too much.

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of my recommended financial tools that will enhance your experience of managing your finance:
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vanguard.com&quot;&gt;Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; - Financial advisor and brokerage. In my opinion this is the best broker in the market for its low expense ratio funds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/go/wealthfront&quot;&gt;Wealthfront*&lt;/a&gt; - If you prefer a more DIFM (Do it for me) investment, Wealthfront offers some excellent options of auto investment. It also offers a cash account with high APY compared to other alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/go/robinhood&quot;&gt;Robinhood*&lt;/a&gt; - Commission-free investing app. You can purchase stocks for zero fee using the app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.personalcapital.com&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; - It is a free tool to manage and keep track of your investiments. You can also track your transactions, networth, asset allocation, retirement analysis and more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mint.com&quot;&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt; - It is another alternative to Personal Capital. It does not offer as many features as PC but less is more. The UI looks cleaner in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/go/ynab&quot;&gt;YNAB*&lt;/a&gt; - If you prefer a more DIY budgeting tools, I highly recommend YNAB. The site also features some workshop to guide you more about budgeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Managing finance is never easy but these tools hopefully will ease you into taking a more active role in doing it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jason</name></author><category term="en" /><category term="finance" /><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Here is a list of my recommended financial tools that will enhance your experience of managing your finance:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">About Unit Tests</title><link href="https://jasonthai.me/blog/2019/06/12/about-unit-tests/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="About Unit Tests" /><published>2019-06-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-06-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jasonthai.me/blog/2019/06/12/about-unit-tests</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jasonthai.me/blog/2019/06/12/about-unit-tests/">&lt;p&gt;Today while trying to deploy some of my codes, I ran into an issue such that the build kept failing. Turned out that some of my unit tests were failing. The unit tests did pass before, which is why all the builds until now have been successful. How come they failed today? Upon investigating more, it turns out there is a timestamp validation in the code which has been successfully validated until now but the unit test did not cover that case. I ended up deploying a hotfix to unblock the build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more context, my unit test was similar to this one (conceptually):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sampleTest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This test will pass until 2020-01-01 12:00:00&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;assertTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;currentTimeMillis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1577836800000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this test will run fine until it does not. For my specific test, the validation stopped working today.
I learned a hard lesson today. As a code reviewer, it is important to not only look at codes but also the unit tests and see if they cover all the possible cases. Otherwise, we will have to spend a lot of time debugging issues like this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jason</name></author><category term="en" /><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Today while trying to deploy some of my codes, I ran into an issue such that the build kept failing.

&lt;p&gt;TinyAlias is no longer in service but I am still hosting it on Heroku so you can try out its functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access the heroku app here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyalias.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;https://tinyalias.herokuapp.com&lt;/a&gt; (It may take sometimes to wake up since this service is now hosted for free).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hosting my own custom url shortener service &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyalias.com&quot;&gt;TinyAlias&lt;/a&gt; for about 6 months, I learned a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many available services on the internet. Some provide more functionalities than the others.
&lt;br /&gt;
Most people use the service for spam and phishing purposes - Same link is shortened multiple times.
&lt;br /&gt;
Determining if links are safe is hard - Most services are not able to provide such information.
&lt;br /&gt;
Links are mostly distributed through emails - Most links are images embedded in emails.
&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of users are robos - They can be configured to use the service in a programmatical way. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Links are auto rejected by various websites - They all have mechanisms to block the shortened links on their sites.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, a lot of companies use shortened links with their own vanity domains which feature thair brands to promote their service and that is a good use case for the service.
Also it is great to send someone a short link rather than a very long one, which is the main purpose of these services.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jason</name></author><category term="en" /><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">TinyAlias is no longer in service but I am still hosting it on Heroku so you can try out its functionality.
