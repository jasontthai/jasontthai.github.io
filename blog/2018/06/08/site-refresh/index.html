There have been some changes since the last time I was here. It has been a year since CastAR’s shutdown. Joining CastAR has been a life-changing experience for me as I embarked on start up journey. Needless to say, despite the shutdown, I had a wonderful experience at my first start up and it really helped me embrace the start up vibe. Now I am working at a new company called Nauto which has a different set of problems to solve and I have to say I am as excited as ever to continue the start up journey. In case you are not aware of Nauto, our company is trying to make driving smarter and safer by engaging with some of the biggest commercial fleets and insurance companies to help measure drivers’ attentiveness and their driving skills through our multi-sensor device with powerful AI engine that gets installed in commmercial vehicles. You can always check out for more information in the link I mentioned. With that I am going to end the first post of this refreshed site. Take it easy." />
